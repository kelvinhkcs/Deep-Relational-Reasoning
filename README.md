# Deep-Relational-Reasoning
This is the code repository of the paper "Are Large Language Models Capable of Deep Relational Reasoning? Insights from DeepSeek-R1 and Benchmark Comparisons"

The .py and ipynb for reproducing the experiments are all uploaded. Examples are given in the .ipynb file.

To run the code successfully, you need to define some folders to store the data generated and the json file after LLMs' evaluation, for example, the folder 'Data' and 'Data/Graph' for storing data, and the folder 'DS_r1_40' for storing the LLMs' evaluation with DeepSeek-r1 and n=40. Inside 'DS_r1_40', you shall have six folders, for example, 'DS_r1_40/Sisters' and 'DS_r1_40/Shortest' for storing those evaluation results for the respective cases.
